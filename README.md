# Classes and Tutorials! 👩🏽‍💻

Mostly when I work on these, I like to go through the process of writing the code myself. There are starter files, sure, but similar to writing on paper, something about tapping it out myself helps solidify the lesson(s) and helps me, I think, build up some muscle memories and instincts.

I can sometimes take an ice age to finish a tutorial. 🤷🏽‍♀️
